## Concentrations of dissolved dimethyl sulfide (DMS), methanethiol and other trace gases in context of microbial communities from the temperate Atlantic to the Arctic Ocean

- Repo describing bacterial community analysis published in Gros et al. (https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/20/851/2023/). Samples collected along a transect from 55-80Â°N (TRANSSIZ expedition on RV Polarstern; PS92) were evaluated for microbial communities and trace gas concentrations. Microbes were sampled underway using "AUTOFIM" automatic filtration; and amplicon-sequenced using 16S rRNA primers. Raw sequence data is available at ENA under BioProject PRJEB50492.

- This repo describes bacterial community and correlation analyses, via the following data:
  - [Rmarkdown for primer-clipping, DADA2 and tax assignment](./1_DADA.Rmd)
  - [Rscript for ASV and metadata processing, alpha-diversity calculations](./2_DataLoad.R)
  - [Rscript for generation of manuscript figures](./3_Results.R)
  - [Rscript for generation of supplementary figures](./4_Supplement.R)
  - Metadata and environmental parameters as .txt files
