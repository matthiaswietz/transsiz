## Samples from North Atlantic transect from 55-80Â°N (TRANSSIZ expedition PSXXX; 
# microbes sampled underway using "Autofim" autmaitc filtration; and amplicon-sequenced using 16S rRNA primers
# Major focus: volatile organic carbon (e.g. DMS, MeSH)
# Rationale: links of bacteria with VOCs?
# This repo describes bacterial community and correlation analyses
