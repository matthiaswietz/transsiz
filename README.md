## Variability of dimethyl sulphide (DMS), methanethiol and other trace gases in relation with microbial communities from the temperate Atlantic to the Arctic Ocean

- Rscripts for bacterial community analysis in Gros et al (XXX). Here, samples collected along a transect from 55-80Â°N (TRANSSIZ expedition PSXXX) were evaluated for microbial communities and trace gas concentrations. Microbes  were sampled underway using "Autofim" automatic filtration; and amplicon-sequenced using 16S rRNA primers
- This repo describes bacterial community and correlation analyses - are there latitudinal patterns along the transcet, and correlations with trace gases?
